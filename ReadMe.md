## Abstract
* * *
Harassment is a prevailing and challenging problem in our society, leading to various types of abuse. This research studies three different scenarios of harassment: online, real-world, and a mix of both. We analyze online posts describing specific problems within each scenario and solve such problems using natural language processing.

In digital space, many apps can be misused for stalking and spying purposes. We found that app reviews reveal critical information about misused functionalities. These reviews are useful in auditing such apps and preventing further misuse. We leverage app reviews (written by victims, abusers, and third parties) to identify such problematic apps and their misused functionalities.


In the space of real-world harassment, we focus on the problem of sexual harassment and assault. Survivors of such experiences freely share their MeToo stories on platforms such as Reddit. However, due to the high character limit per post, such stories could be long and demanding to read, which may challenge prospective helpers to provide effective responses. We develop a natural-language-based tool that highlights important parts of long stories, in turn facilitating helpers in providing effective support. In the same real-world scenario, we also understand how the language of MeToo stories reflects on violations of survivors' consent. We linguistically study multiple criteria of consent and how their violations are expressed.    

In the mixed scenario, we understand an unexplored yet interesting form of speech, inciting speech. We investigate public WhatsApp messages and identify rhetorical strategies used to incite readers against a religious community. On social media, inciting speech can be disturbing to read (online harassment) and may lead to violence against its target in the real world. We understand the nature of such speech along with its prevalence on multiple platforms against multiple targets.


Overall, we employ NLP techniques to understand natural language text and build computational models addressing harassment in all three scenarios.
