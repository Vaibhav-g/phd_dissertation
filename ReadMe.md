## Abstract
* * *
Harassment poses a significant challenge in our society, encompassing various forms of abuse and misconduct. This research explores three distinct harassment scenarios: online harassment, real-world harassment, and online harassment leading to real-world consequences. Online harassment involves disturbing text, dissemination of personal information, and threats inflicted on individuals. Real-world harassment refers to unwelcome conduct based on attributes such as sex. The third scenario encompasses harassment initiated online that extends into the real world. This research identifies specific problems within each scenario, leverage posts describing such scenarios, and proposes computational solutions to address them.

We identify that app reviews contain rich information about the misuse of mobile apps by abusers to access the information of victims (online harassment). These dual-use apps violate victims’ privacy expectations and need attention from app developers and platforms. We leverage the information embedded within app reviews, which are often utilized by both abusers and victims, natural language processing (NLP) techniques can be applied to identify problematic apps and their functionalities.

Focusing on real-world harassment, the research addresses the prevalent problem of sexual harassment, where survivors often seek support and advice through anonymous online platforms. Reddit’s subreddits, including r/meToo, provide a space for survivors to share their experiences. However, the length of these posts can make it challenging for prospective helpers to provide effective responses. To alleviate this issue, a natural language-based model is developed to identify key information within these lengthy posts, including the incident, effects on the survivor, and sought advice, facilitating more targeted and supportive responses.

The research also explores the issue of inciting speech prevalent on social media platforms,particularly examining WhatsApp posts in Indian political groups targeting the Muslim community. Inciting speech, which can lead to both online and real-world harassment, is often subtle and challenging to identify. NLP techniques are employed to detect inciting sentences within social media posts.

Overall, this research offers computational approaches to mitigate harassment problems in three scenarios. By leveraging NLP techniques, it aims to enhance the identification of problematic apps, streamline support on online platforms, detect inciting speech, and gain insights into consent-related issues, thus contributing to the advancement of research in addressing harassment.
